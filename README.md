# Video-Games-Sales-Prediction--Asterisc

In this project, we set out to predict global sales of video games based on various features including critic scores, user scores, and other attributes. The analysis included data exploration, preprocessing, and the training of regression models.

Key Steps:
- Data Exploration: We started by understanding the dataset, identifying significant features, and gaining insights into the video game sales data.
- Data Preprocessing: This step involved handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. We also calculated 'Age_of_Game' and dropped unnecessary columns.
- Model Training: Using Linear Regression, we trained models to predict sales in different regions (NA, EU, JP, Other) as well as aggregated global sales.
- Model Evaluation: We evaluated the models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to ensure the accuracy of our predictions.
